            <div class="more-details">
              <p>This job is my giant leap into a new career path. I will be working with a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, jQuery and AS/400 machines (IBM i). My role is rather a flexible one and full-stacked.</p>
              <ul> 
                <li>provide support and training for our customers, both for our software as well as a little bit of web development</li>

                <li>develop minor fixes and updates</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It's a rewarding experience to be able to take issues or requests from client, develop a fix or update that is meaningful to them, and deliver it to the clients. I most certainly enjoy the full-stack development for this reason.</p>

            <div class="more-details">
              <p>My role was much of what my title said; I estimated and bidded on projects, as either a sub-contractor or as a general contractor. I'd estimated projects ranging from small $10,000+ projects, upgrading city roads and service lines, all the way to massive multi-million dollar projects, expanding a shopping mall or building an underground parking.</p>
              <p>The division I worked in focused mainly on civil and earthwork, though the company also does construction of residential homes and commercial units as well. I sometimes got asked to help do up drawings of these units but they were not my main responsibilities.</p>

            <p>A chance to work on a P3 project building this multi-million dollars LEED-certified hospital building like is not to be turned down. I was hired by the Patient Care Centre project team specificly for this project. My main role was in leading research projects around the hospital such as space utilization, stocking plan, and traffic flow. Being the one guy with strong technical background in the office means I also ended up taking over many work out side of my scope. This includes handling technical documents that comes through the office from the contractors or sitting in on the IT meeting. It worked out well for me though, since I got to be more involved with different aspects of what was going on.</p> 
            <p>It was an amazing experience to see the building coming together like that. It's too bad the project had to be completed.</p>

            <div class="more-details">
              <p>Avcorp is an aircraft detail manufacturer, and I worked in a New Product Introduction department ( they called it NPI for short ). My role here was my first dap at project management with a mix of technical. Our responsible was to oversee new projects until it reached steady-state and was ready to be handed-over to the production team. My notable projects were re-purposing the water-jet cutter and helping started erosion strips and other new projects. And of course, there were some administrative works like managed databases of drawings, and documenting various reports.</p>
              <p>The nature of the department dictated the need for a mix of team members from each department that will be involved in the project after us. That meant everyone was their own expert. I was able to learn so much from this integrated team, something new every day.</p>

              <p>My employment at Taylor Munro was my very first co-op work term in my engineering program. The company is in the renewable energy sector, providing solar-heated water system. We designed and built for both new homes and retro-fitting old homes.</p>
              <p>My job was to create CAD drawings and assemblies for design use, write assembly manuals and quick references for how to program water pumps, and specify and test hardware. I was also tasked to pick out a new computer and software for 3D CAD.</p>
              <p>The work was part brainy work, part hands-on work so it was a lot of fun being there. During the down time I would be in the shop helping the guys assembling solar panels or storage tank, or setting up pumps to specs.</p>
